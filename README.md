## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

For this project to run you need .NET Core 3.1 installed on your computer [you can follow this link to download it (Windows, Linux, macOS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bikedataproject/geo-api.git
```
2. Restore the package.

As we are using a `homemade` NuGet package, create a `nuget.config` file in the local root folder of your freshly cloned repository
Paste the following in the file, replace `GitHubUsername` with your own GitHub username and `AccessPassword` with a GitHub Token [tutorial to get the informations needed in the file](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-dotnet-cli-for-use-with-github-packages):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
    <packageSources>
        <clear />
        <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
        <add key="github" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/bikedataproject/index.json" />
    </packageSources>
    <packageSourceCredentials>
        <github>
            <add key="Username" value="GitHubUsername" />
            <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="AccessPassword" />
        </github>
    </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```
3. Restore the dependencies

In the project folder (`./src/BikeDataProject.API/`), use the following command:
```sh
dotnet restore
```
4. Launch the project

You can launch the project by typing the following command in the project folder (`./src/BikeDataProject.API/`): 
```sh

## Usage
This API is used to store gps tracks that comes from our [mobile application](https://github.com/bikedataproject/app) but also to delete data from users (those who linked their Strava account with our service, those who donated their data via .GPX/.FIT files or those who used our mobile application).
